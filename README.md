# http-keyboard

A simple website that allows remote keyboard and mouse control to the server.

This was meant to be used if an external or wireless keyboard or touchpad/mouse is not available, but a device such as a tablet is.

To use it, the device must simply connect to the website using a browser, the target computer must allow the connection, and the device must then enter the code given in `./server/code.txt` on the target computer.

If on a mobile device, click the blank screen if the keyboard doesn't show up.

See `./client/README.md` and `./server/README.md` for more information on how to set it up.
